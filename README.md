# Chat Room Application

This is a simple NodeJS implementation that hosts chat rooms for various usersnames without user authentication. All you need is a username and room name to join. Implementation tracks for duplicate non case sensitive usernames in the same room, therefore no duplicate usernames allowed. 

This app was created using Socket.io.

App is currently deployed on Heroku at [https://gabe-chat-app.herokuapp.com/](https://gabe-chat-app.herokuapp.com/).
